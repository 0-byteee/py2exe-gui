Some antivirus software may detect the application as suspicious due to executable packaging. This is a false positive. Add the application to your antivirus exclusion list.

**Application does not start**  
Run as administrator and ensure all files were extracted properly.

**Conversion fails**  
Check that the Python script contains no errors and required dependencies are installed.

**Missing DLL error**  
Install the latest Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable.
